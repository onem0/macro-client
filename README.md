# macro-client

This is a macro client by me.

# How to use it

You have to download the file and start it using ```node index.js```. You must have NodeJS installed. Here the download link: https://nodejs.org/en/download

When you have runned the command, you'll get a token. You open this website on your Phone, Tablet, etc. to controll your device: http://45.81.233.200:2000/ (you can change the Port in the config.json). Then put the Token into the input field, create a category and a Shortcut. 

# Create a shortcut

When you create a shortcut, you have to put in this information: 
- Shortcut Name - The title of the shortcut
- Shortcut Description - The text under the Name
- Shortcut Icon - The Icon of the shortcut. You can get the names here: https://fonts.google.com/icons
- Shortcut Color - The color of the Shortcut
- Shortcut Action - What should hapen when you click the shortcut
- Action Name - What app sould open (Then you have to paste in the path and the exe of the program on your Computer)

# Config

If you have pasted something wrongly, you can edit it in the config.json
